## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

A API or application programming interface is said to be rules that allow for applications namely software applications to communicate with each other and this allows for there to be a exchange of data. it allows for two systems to share and integrate with each other.

Its significance in software development is that it allows for the acceleration of application development by allowing for the integration of data. It also helps with communication between two programs by allowing for the exchange of data and also allows for the leveraging of existing services as well as functionality without having to start any code from scratch.

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

An API is the set of rules and is code that enables to software programs to communicate with each other.
A Inteface is a point where two things meet and interact. This could be people, objects, systems etc.

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

There are three main components of an API. 
API Request: This is a message that is sent to a server which asks the API to provide information or even a service. 
API Response: This is the information that is returned to an app or a server once someone has put in a API request for this informtion. 
The server: This describes a middle ground between client applications and the resources that they are requesting access to. It allows developers to create applications thta can ultimately communicate with each other and allows for them to be able to share data and services more efficiently. 

A Web API is said to be a API that is built into your web browser and allows for data to be exposed from the browser and the computer environment. It is also a API over the web that is accessed using HTTP protocol.

A REST API conforms to the design principles of the representational state transfer. It ensures that data that is stored belongs to one uniform resource identifier and this could be all tyes of data such as a users name or email address etc. It allows for there to be every piece of information that the client needs.

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

I have used certain tools like POST which allows to add date to a server such as a type request and adding contacts to CRM as I use the CRM support desk at work. 
I have also used delete to delete files that are already existing. 

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

RESTful APIs are an area that I feel confident in as I use this at work. 
I feel confident as it allows for the comunication of applications internally and because my job scope covers certain processes and systems that I use such as Acumatica for logging time and timesheet approvals and a bit of invoicing, RESTful allows for this to be exchanged in a manner that is secure and reliable and efficient for my daily duties at work as a support consultant.
